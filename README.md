## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I’m Simphiwe — a lifelong learner with a passion for problem-solving, technology, and data. I recently completed the **FNB App Academy 2025 Full Stack Developer Certificate** and the **WeThinkCode_ Generative AI training** for Software Engineer's.

With a strong foundation in mathematics, applied mathematics and a growing portfolio of software projects, I’m building tools that merge theory and application — from dynamic web apps to intelligent AI solutions.
